# Introduction to scae-library

The Source Code Anlyser Engine Library takes in a piece of source code
and a style rulebook, and returns suggestion on how the style of the source
code can be improved.

Here you can see the documentation for the code of the library.

See www.source-code-analyser-engine.com/documentation for more detailed
documentation on the system as a whole.
