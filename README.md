## Preface


This project was written by myself, Bernard O'Connor, for my Final Year
Project in Computer Applications & Software Engineering BSc in
Dublin City University, 2017-2018.

I have migrated the project to github from the University's private gitlab,
but have otherwise left the project unchanged.

The project received a First Class Honours with a mark of 85.


## Source Code Analyser Engine

The project is the Source Code Analyser Engine. The aim of the project is to create a library that can be 
used to promote the writing of quality code, that other developers may use to asses their own code or 
to incorporate into their own projects.

The project is split into two sub projects / components; the Library and the Web
Application.

The Library is the main focus of the project. The library is what analyses the source code and returns 
either style suggestions or the generated
Abstract Syntax Tree.

The Web Application acts as both the home of the project and as an example of the types of
applications a user of the Library could make. The Web Application
offers a number of services thatâ€™s 
allow the user to try out the library before installing it locally.
