# Blog: Source-Code-Analyser-Engine

## Blog #1 (1/11/2017)

#### What I've Done:
My project, the Source Code Analyser Engine, has been approved.

I've met with my Project Supervisor, Dr David Sinclair, to discuss what needs to be done with my Functional Specification, which is the next deliverable for the project. 

I have started work on the Functional Specification for the project. I've talked about the business context for the project, and its future open source nature.

#### What I am Currently Doing:
I am currently fleshing out the User Characteristics and Use Case Scenario sections of the Functional Specification. Once I work out exactly what the User will wish to achieve with my system, it will be easier to design the required functionality to achieve these goals. 


#### What I Will Do:
Next I will work on the Functional Requirements for the Functional Specification. Also before my next Supervisor meeting I will try to create  an early mock up of the UI for the supporting website that I will be building for the Source Code Analyser Engine Project.



## Blog #2 (19/11/2017)
It has been a little while since my last blog post. The various assignments and working on the functional spec has kept me on myt toes.

#### What I've Done:
I've fleshed out the Use Case Scenarios and the Functional Requirements some more.

While doing so I've come to a better understanding of my design. Before I was picturing developing two versions of my project, a web-process and an offline process.
While working on my Functional Requirements, I have realised that instead I should be making a java Library. The users of the project (who are all developers) will then make calls to the API of this library from their own web-processes / offline processes.
I have gone back to previous sections of my Functional Spec to make sure that this slight change of scope has been accounted for.


I also met with my supervisor last Thursday (16/11/2017). We discussed how much I should focus my functional specification on my main project vs example uses of my project, and about a sequence diagram I made, shown below.

#### What I am Currently Doing:
I am working on getting as much of the functional spec done for the next supervisor meeting on Tuesday, so I can recieve feedback before the due date on friday. Currently I am working on again adding more detail to the functional requirements and making some initial diagrams for the high level design.



#### What I Will Do:
Finish the Functional Specification for Friday.
