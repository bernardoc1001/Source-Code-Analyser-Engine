#### What I've Done:
My project, the Source Code Analyser Engine, has been approved.

I've met with my Project Supervisor, Dr David Sinclair, to discuss what needs to be done with my Functional Specification, which is the next deliverable for the project. 

I have started work on the Functional Specification for the project. I've talked about the business context for the project, and its future open source nature.

#### What I am Currently Doing:
I am currently fleshing out the User Characteristics and Use Case Scenario sections of the Functional Specification. Once I work out exactly what the User will wish to achieve with my system, it will be easier to design the required functionality to achieve these goals. 


#### What I Will Do:
Next I will work on the Functional Requirements for the Functional Specification. Also before my next Supervisor meeting I will try to create  an early mock up of the UI for the supporting website that I will be building for the Source Code Analyser Engine Project.
